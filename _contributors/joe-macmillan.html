Joe MacMillan is a hard-driving former IBM sales executive who oozes charisma. When he shows up at Cardiff Electric, he essentially bulldozes his way into a senior position on the sales team. Once he has the job, he immediately orchestrates a plan to reverse-engineer his former employer's product and build something better, but his ultimate agenda is unknown. While Joe handles the sales for this new personal computer, he enlists the help of Gordon Clark and Cameron Howe to build this next-generation product.
