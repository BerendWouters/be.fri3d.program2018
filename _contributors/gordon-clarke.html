Gordon Clark is a once-promising engineer who longs for a redo of his past before the humiliating and public failure of Symphonic, a computer he created with his wife, Donna, which failed to turn on at COMDEX, the computer industry trade show. After that, Gordon moved his family to Dallas, Donnaâ€™s hometown, and took a job at Cardiff Electric. Before Joe MacMillan approaches him with a plan to reverse-engineer the IBM PC, Gordon had been sleepwalking through life working at a job he is unhappy with.
