Cameron Howe, born "Catherine", is a volatile prodigy who drops out of college and puts her future in jeopardy to join Joe MacMillan's rogue PC project. This 22 year old programmer is a shock to the system of conservative, old-guard Cardiff Electric, but she simultaneously represents what is next in the world of computing while delivering a slap in the face to the traditionally male-dominated 1980s tech industry.
